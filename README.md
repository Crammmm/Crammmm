### Welcome!
It's extremely cool to have you — such a magnificent object, — in my presence.

Please, take a seat while I introduce myself.

I am the inept programmer of C# and nothing in between.
I create and bugcheck for 7 hours, a contradiction so beautiful yet so annoyoing.

System.out.println("...")
(Look at my stackoverflow)
